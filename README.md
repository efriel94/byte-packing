# Byte Packing

This is a byte packing program wrote in C++11 which illustrates how to pack data into different data structures.

Main use case for byte packing is to reduce memory footprint of applications that deal with large data sets that often hit memory limits or for memory constrained systems such as embedded systems or kernels.

## Build and Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/efriel94/byte-packing.git
g++ -Wall main.cpp -o main
./main
```
